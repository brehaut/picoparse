# We define common primative parsers by partial application. This is similar to the lexical 
# analysis stage of a more traditional parser tool.
#
# Note here is that these simple parsers are just specialisations of the general purpose
# 'one_of' parser that will accept any item that is the provided iterable.
#   partial(one_of, '<') is equivalent to lambda: one_of('<')
# This is an important idea with picoparse, as it lets you express the specialisation more
# succinctly and more precisely than defing a whole new function

# as an integer. build_string wraps up u''.join(iterable) for us. 
def hex_value():
    return int(build_string(many(hex_decimal_digit)), 16)

# The next primatives we need are for the XML name type. The specification for this is reasonably 
# involved; instead of manually implementing it, we are going to create a new parser for the
# grammer that the spec ifself uses. This parser will generate a new parser for us.
#
# To be clear, this piece of code creates a parser that runs when the module is loaded, not when
# parsing the XML itself.
#
# First we are going to create parsers for the individual characters that may appear in the spec,
# then we are going to define parsers for a character range.

# In the XML character spec, a hexdecimal digit begins with '#x'; cue is a parser combinator.
# it takes two parsers, runs the first, and then if that accepts, it runs the second and returns 
# the result. You can see that we are defining a specialisation of cue with a specialisation of 
# string (which only accepts if the input matches the iterable it is given), and hex_value above.
char_spec_hex = partial(cue, partial(string, '#x'), hex_value)

# The next two parsers use a function 'compose' as well as nested partials. This is creating
# a parser that returns a parser. compose(f, g) is equivalent to f(g()). 
char_spec_single_char = compose(partial(partial, one_of), quoted)
char_spec_single_hex_char = compose(partial(partial, one_of), char_spec_hex)

# Now that we have parsers for the different notations for characters, we need to create a parser
# that can choose the correct parser to use. For this we are going to specialise 'choice', This 
# combinator is given a set of parsers to try in order; If a parser fails, it backtracks and tries
# the next, until one succeeds. If none succeed, then the choice fails. 
char_spec_range_char = partial(choice, char_spec_hex, any_token)

# The second part of the character spec is a range. This is more complex that previous parsers
# and we are using a def for it. This parser takes advantage of the previous definition of 
# the char_spec_range_char to find either literal characters or hexdecimal codepoints.
# It returns a new parser specialising 'satisfies'. satisfies takes a function that is called 
# against the input. In this case we are creating a parser that checks that a character is within
# the given range

# This is the top level parser for the chararacter spec. sep1 is a combinator that finds something
# seperated by something else. In this case it finds one of a range, a single character or a hex 
# character, and the seperator is a '|'. sep and sep1 return a list.
#
# Secondly, note the 'eof()' here. This parser is checking that we have reached the end of the input
#
# The last thing to be aware of is that each of the choices _returns a list of parsers_
